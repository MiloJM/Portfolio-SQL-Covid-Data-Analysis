# Covid Data Analysis - SQL Work

This is an analysis of global covid data from 2020-1 to 2023-2.  

I used this data in order to get some practical experience working with many of the basic SQL functions while exploring an interesting piece of real world data.  

I have created a series of queries ranging from fairly simple to moderately complex. I attempt to glean meaningful observations related to the covid crisis regarding population size, total cases, total deaths, and how these data points relate across countries and continents.  

I have also created a Tableau visualization of some of the findings within this SQL analysis.
