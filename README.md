# Covid Data Analysis - SQL Work

This is an analysis of global covid data from 2020-1 to 2023-2.  

I used this data in order to get some practical experience working with many of the basic SQL functions while exploring an interesting piece of real world data.  

I have created a series of queries ranging from fairly simple to moderately complex. I attempt to glean meaningful observations related to the covid crisis regarding population size, total cases, total deaths, and how these data points relate across countries and continents.  

This analysis was done with help from a youtube tutorial from 'Alex the Analyst'.
